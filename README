"JUG" - Java Uuid Generator

JUG is a set of Java classes for generating UUIDs. It generates UUIDs according to the UUID specification (IETF draft), found  (for example) at:

http://www1.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/uuid-guid/draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt

or at Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID

[draft id being '<draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt>']

Alternatively you can also read newer IETF draft that described URN name space for UUIDs, as it contains UUID definition:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uuid-urn-00.txt

JUG can be used as a command-line tool (via class 'com.fasterxml.uuid.Jug;), or as a pluggable component; see file USAGE for details.

JUG was created by Tatu Saloranta (<tatu.saloranta@iki.fi>).
In addition, many other individuals have helped fix bugs and implement new feeatures: please see CREDITS for the complete list.
